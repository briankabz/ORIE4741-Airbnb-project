## Introduction
<h3>Introduction</h3>
From thousands of listings in different cities, Airbnb has become a massive sink of information. Data provided by homeowners are often big, messy, yet, extremely useful. The goal of this project is to extract knowledge from these datasets by  applying techniques and methodologies common in data mining.
As more homeowners put their properties on the platform, Airbnb is able to suggest appropriate prices for the listings based on machine learning models trained over large sets of data. Our team aims to predict the prices of the listings in New York City, to allow homeowners to price their properties appropriately. Specifically, we seek to answer the following question: What prices should Airbnb suggest to their hosts given a set of features about the listing? This question is important because as more data becomes available, more intelligence can be extracted using modern machine learning tools. Therefore, it is worthwhile in exploring data driven analyses similar to those presented in this report as they are likely to improve experience for both hosts and customers, and ultimately add value to the company.
